# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering

## Problem Statement

The project involves performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering on a dataset of wine attributes. The objectives include:

- Applying PCA to the data.
- Visualizing the PCA results.
- Performing hierarchical clustering to obtain the optimum number of clusters.
- Using the K-means algorithm for clustering and determining the ideal number of clusters.
- Comparing the clustering results with the original data.

## Introduction

The project focuses on exploring dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering methods to understand and analyze a dataset of wine attributes. It aims to determine the optimal number of clusters in the data and compare these clusters with the original wine types.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the wine dataset, which contains various attributes of wines. The dataset is loaded and explored during the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install them using `pip install`.

## PCA

- Normalization of data
- Applying PCA
- Visualization using line plots and scatterplots

## Hierarchical Clustering

- Creating a dendrogram
- Identifying the number of clusters
- Agglomerative clustering

## K-Means Clustering

- Using the elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Applying K-means clustering with the selected number of clusters

## Results

The project provides insights into PCA and clustering techniques and their applications in dimensionality reduction and grouping data. It compares the clustered data with the original wine types to assess the performance of clustering methods.
